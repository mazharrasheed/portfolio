            I’m a self-taught web developer with a passion for building modern, responsive web applications using 
            <strong> Django</strong> and <strong>React</strong>. My journey began with curiosity and has grown into a skill set 
            that includes full-stack development, RESTful APIs, and clean UI design.

            I love solving real-world problems through code and continuously learning new technologies. Whether it's 
            creating dynamic dashboards, integrating backend logic, or deploying apps, I’m always up for the challenge.
          </p>
          <p className="fs-5">
            When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring open-source projects, reading about new tools, and helping others learn.
